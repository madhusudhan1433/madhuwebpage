Madhu Login Page
This is a simple login page that allows users to enter their username and password to access a protected area of the website. The login page is built using HTML and can be used as a starting point for building more complex login systems.

Installation
To use this login page, simply download the madhu.html file and place it in your web server directory. You may also need to modify the HTML code to suit your specific needs, such as changing the styling or adding additional fields.

Usage
To use the login page, simply open the madhu.html file in a web browser and enter a valid username and password. If the credentials are correct, the user will be redirected to the protected area of the website. If the credentials are incorrect, an error message will be displayed.
